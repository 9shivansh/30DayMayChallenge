1st problem of the May Leetcode Challenge.
1st approach was to just traverse through all of the numbers and then call the API one by one. (Time Limit Exceeded & also it is written to minimize the number of API calls.
2nd approach was to implement the binary search over this sorted sequence. (Issue faced was to implement using recursion and not by using while loop: more difficult to implement).
3rd was taking into consideration what type of input are we getting. (Long, Int etc.)
